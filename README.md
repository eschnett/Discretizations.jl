# Discretizations.jl

Abstractions for discrete representations of fields to solve PDEs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eschnett/Discretizations.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eschnett/Discretizations.jl)

This Julia package contains abstractions to represent discretizations
of fields, as needed to solve PDEs. Currently, this is mostly an
implementation of `VectorSpace`, with `Domain` and `Field` to follow.
